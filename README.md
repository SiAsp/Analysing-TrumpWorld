# Analysing-TrumpWorld
A simplistic introductory analysis of Buzzfeeds dataset containing Donald Trumps connections compiled as a list of the people and organisations in his network and how they relate to each other.

In 2017 BuzzFeed News posted an article requesting help in analysing a network they have named TrumpWorld, a file containing now President Donald Trumps connections compiled as a list of the people and organisations in his network and how they relate to each other. The aim of their venture was to shed light on the then new Presidents relations to better understand how these might affect public policy. The data is built from public records, news reports, and other sources on the Trump family, his Cabinet picks, and top advisers.
This repository includes the Buzzfeed News dataset and the Jupyter Notebook used to conduct the introductory analysis.
